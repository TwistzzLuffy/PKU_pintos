## Booting Pintos

>A1: Put the screenshot of Pintos running example here.



## Debugging

#### QUESTIONS: BIOS 

>B1: What is the first instruction that gets executed?

ljmp   $0x3630,$0xf000e05b

>B2: At which physical address is this instruction located?

0xffff0


#### QUESTIONS: BOOTLOADER

>B3: How does the bootloader read disk sectors? In particular, what BIOS interrupt is used?

label :  read_sector (in loader.asm)

>B4: How does the bootloader decides whether it successfully finds the Pintos kernel?

he kernel's drive is in DL., 	# Is it a Pintos kernel partition?
	cmpb $0x20, %es:4(%si)

>B5: What happens when the bootloader could not find the Pintos kernel?

一直重复，来读入

>B6: At what point and how exactly does the bootloader transfer control to the Pintos kernel?



#### QUESTIONS: KERNEL

>B7: At the entry of pintos_init(), what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?

=> 0xc000efef:  int3
=> 0xc000efef:  int3
$2 = (uint32_t *) 0xc00

>B8: When `palloc_get_page()` is called for the first time,

>> B8.1 what does the call stack look like?
>>

Stack level 0, frame at 0xc000efa0:
 eip = 0xc002311a in palloc_get_page (../../threads/palloc.c:113);

>> B8.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?
>>

&init_page_dir : 0xc000efc4

init_page_dir : ==0xc0101000==

*init_page_dir : 0

>> B8.3 what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?
>>

=> 0xc000ef9f:  int3
=> 0xc000ef9f:  int3
$9 = ==0xc0101c00==

>B9: When palloc_get_page() is called for the third time,

>> B9.1 what does the call stack look like?
>>

Stack level 0, frame at 0xc000ef60:

## Kernel Monitor

>C1: Put the screenshot of your kernel monitor running example here. (It should show how your kernel shell respond to `whoami`, `exit`, and `other input`.)

#### 

>C2: Explain how you read and write to the console for the kernel monitor.

input_getc()

printf
